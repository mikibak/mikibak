<font size="5">**My most significant university projects from semesters 1-3 are now here!**</font>

In the near future I plan on adding assembly code and implementation of algorithms in C. I could get in trouble for publishing code related to subjects that I
have not yet passed (other students copying it...) so I will publish all of my fourth semester work in June.

If for some reason you want to see other projects such as concurrency in Ada and various programs in Matlab, Haskell and Smalltalk - let me know on LinkedIn, I'll be happy to publish them if anyone is interested.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: C# application
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Numerical methods
